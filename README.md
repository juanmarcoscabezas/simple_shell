# Simple Shell

The simple shell project is the largest and most difficult project we have worked on at Holberton School.
This project consists of creating a shell so that it behaves very similar to the Bourne Shell "sh".

This project was built by Alejandro LÃ³pez and Juan Marcos Cabezas

# Features
- The main function uses structures to call the function corresponding to the case, this allows greater code scalability.
- As in the original printf, the function has a buffer that stores and prints the output strings every 1024 bytes.
- Just like the original printf, the returns of our function are the number of characters printed, when the input is incorrect the return is error -1
